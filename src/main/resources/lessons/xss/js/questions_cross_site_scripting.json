    "text": "Is a well known website, like Netflix, immune to XSS attacks?",
    "solutions": {
      "1": "Yes, they are safe because the browser checks the code before executing.",
      "2": "Yes, because Google has got an algorithm that blocks malicious code.",
      "3": "No, because the script that is executed will break through the defense algorithm of the browser.",
      "4": "No, because the browser trusts the website if it is acknowledged trusted, then the browser does not know that the script is malicious."
    }
  }, {
    "text": "When do XSS attacks occur?",
    "solutions": {
      "1": "When malicious scripts are injected into a website's server-side code.",
      "2": "When a user submits sensitive information without encryption.",
      "3": "When a website fails to validate or sanitize user input, allowing malicious scripts to be executed in a user's browser.",
      "4": "When a website uses outdated SSL/TLS protocols."
    }
  }, {
    "text": "What are Stored XSS attacks?",
    "solutions": {
      "1": "The script is permanently stored on the server and the victim gets the malicious script when requesting information from the server.",
      "2": "The script stores itself on the computer of the victim and executes locally the malicious code.",
      "3": "The script stores a virus on the computer of the victim. The attacker can perform various actions now.",
      "4": "The script is stored in the browser and sends information to the attacker."
    }
  }, {
    "text": "What are Reflected XSS attacks?",
    "solutions": {
      "1": "Reflected attacks reflect malicious code from the database to the web server and then reflect it back to the user.",
      "2": "They reflect the injected script off the web server. That occurs when input sent to the web server is part of the response.",
      "3": "Reflected attacks reflect from the firewall off to the database where the user requests information from.",
      "4": "Reflected XSS is an attack where the injected script is reflected off the database and web server to the user."
    }
  }, {
    "text": "Is JavaScript the only way to perform XSS attacks?",
    "solutions": {
      "1": "Yes, you can only make use of tags through JavaScript.",
      "2": "Yes, otherwise you cannot steal cookies.",
      "3": "No, there is ECMAScript too.",
      "4": "No, there are many other ways. Like HTML, Flash or any other type of code that the browser executes."
